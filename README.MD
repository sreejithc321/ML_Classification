# Classification

Classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, 
on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.

- knn_classification : In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, 
        with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors. 
        If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
        
- log_reg_classification : Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more 
                        independent variables, which are usually (but not necessarily) continuous, by estimating probabilities.
